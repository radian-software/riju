# Reporting a security issue

Please contact me at
[radon.neon@gmail.com](mailto:radon.neon@gmail.com) if you find any
way to:

* Take down Riju without using a large number of concurrent sessions.
* View or interfere with another user's session.
* Tamper with the Riju server.

Although I work on Riju in my free time, I take security seriously, so
I will do my best to get back to you in less than a week, and to
correct the vulnerability as soon as possible (I will let you know the
likely timeline by email).
